 For acronym.py it all works bt it returns none at the end i'm not so sure why but other than that it works. For rle, i worked on it after the exam. The first encode and decode functions work. The next two encode functions after that are the ones I was actually working with during the exam. It counted the letters in the string. I misunderstoof the question and thought you wanted a word count and realized after that I had read the question wrong. The second encode function was when I was trying to make the dicitonary into a list. the other encode functions are nto working which is why i put the # symbol next to it to comment it out. The final decode function doesn't work. As for scrabble, I worked on it two hours ago, but I had to fix a branch issue I had and as a result I had to push it up a few minutess ago. I finished it shortly after class, but I had just resolved the branch issue and merge issue I had.
