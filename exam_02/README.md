For acronym.py it keeps on printing none after the acronyms, I'm not so sure why this is happening, but other than that the code pretty much works. For rle.py in the encode function, I was able to make the code work, in the first function of encode i wrote, in the second one, I wrote a function to try to make the dictionary into a list, but it only returns one list and doesn't return the right amount for the first code it returns the dictionary with the right count.
