For acronym.py it keeps on printing none after the acronyms, I'm not so sure why this is happening, but other than that the code pretty much works. For rle.py in the encode function, I was able to make the code work, in the first function of encode i wrote, in the second one, I wrote a function to try to make the dictionary into a list, but it only returns one list and doesn't return the right amount for the first code it returns the dictionary with the right count. I uploaded scrabble.py a few minutes after class, but had trouble with a merge problem in my branch. I'm not sure why this is happening but it prevents me from pushing things up to my github. I tried to git merge and git fetch a few things after I do that it works for one thing and just goes back to the way it was perviously. As a result, I uploaded it a bit late, but the scrabble.py works as well. I was also working on decode, but got stuck on trying to split the list of lists, so that function is incomplete for now, I'm currently working on it and will upload it as a separate file once I figure it out.
